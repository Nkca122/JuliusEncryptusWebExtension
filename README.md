## PS-1: Decrypting the Caesar Cipher

### Problem Statement
> _Can you decrypt intercepted messages encoded with the Caesar Cipher to uncover clues about potential attackersâ€˜ strategies and timelines?_

## Our Idea

Creation of An analysis tool which will provide **potential** solutions to the Caesar cipher provided, which can be readily used on any system with a working internet connection, Hence

<h1 display='block' align='center' align='center'> JULIUS ENCRYPTUS </h1>

<p align = 'center'> 
A project to create an API which returns all possible combinations to a caesar cipher and sort them into recommended ones and non recommended ones to smoothline the vetting process. <b>Use our Browser Extension by downloading the julius encryptus zip file and loading the build folder within it into the browser</b>
